**Brainwave_Matrix_Intern: Task 1 - ATM System using Python**  
Welcome to the Task 1 repository for the **ATM System using Python**, part of the Brainwave Matrix Internship. This repository contains all the necessary code and resources for building a basic ATM simulation with features like deposit, withdrawal, balance check, and transaction history.

---

### üìù **Project Overview**  
The goal of this project is to develop a functional **ATM system** using **Python**. The system allows users to securely perform basic banking transactions via a **graphical user interface (GUI)** with voice interaction for user feedback.

### **Key Components**  
- **GUI Interface**: Built using Tkinter to create a user-friendly interface.  
- **PIN Authentication**: Secure access with a 4-digit PIN before any operations.  
- **Voice Interaction**: Integrated with `pyttsx3` for voice prompts and confirmations.  
- **Basic Operations**: Supports deposit, withdrawal, balance inquiry, and transaction history viewing.  
- **Transaction Logging**: Keeps a record of all operations performed in the session.

### üìÇ **Project Structure**  
The repository is structured as follows:

- **ATM_Interface.py**: Source code for the entire ATM system.
- **README.md**: Project overview and instructions (this file).

---

### üìã **Dependencies**  
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- `tkinter`
- `pyttsx3`

### üõ†Ô∏è **Usage**  
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   `[https://github.com/your-username/ATM_System_Project.git](https://github.com/vishnuvytla/Brainwave_Matrix_Intern-Task-1---Fully-Functional-ATM-interface-using-python)`  

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:  
   `cd ATM_Interface`

3. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Ensure that `tkinter` and `pyttsx3` libraries are installed.

4. **Run the ATM Application**:  
   Run the Python script to launch the ATM interface.

---

### üß† **Project Workflow**  
1. **PIN Authentication**:  
   The system prompts the user to enter a 4-digit PIN to access their account.

2. **Deposit/Withdrawal**:  
   Users can perform deposit and withdrawal transactions, with voice feedback for each action.

3. **Balance Inquiry**:  
   Displays the current account balance on the GUI.

4. **Transaction History**:  
   A log of transactions is maintained and can be viewed anytime.

5. **Exit**:  
   Logs the user out, returning them to the PIN entry screen.
